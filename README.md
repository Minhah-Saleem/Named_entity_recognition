Recognition of named entities in medical texts

## Goal
Understanding medication events in clinical notes is essential to achieving a complete picture of a patient's medication history. While prior research has explored identification of medication changes in clinical notes, due to the longitudinal and narrative nature of clinical documentation, extraction of medication change alone without the necessary clinical context is insufficient for use in real-world applications, such as medication timeline generation and medication reconciliation. To bridge this gap, this track aims to capture multi-dimensional context of medication changes documented in clinical notes.
